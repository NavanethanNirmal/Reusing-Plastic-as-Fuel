# Reusing-Plastic-as-Fuel
Reusing plastic as fuel involves converting waste plastic into energy through processes like pyrolysis, gasification, or incineration. This reduces landfill waste and generates valuable energy. Pyrolysis produces liquid fuels, gasification creates syngas, and incineration generates heat and electricity.
